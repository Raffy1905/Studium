Challenges:  
- reply / react to every information (no "non-reactions")  
- make sure there is a default case (no "inappropriate" reactions)  
- reactions should be predictable (no "weird behaviors")  

Interface = interaction channel (soft-/hardware interface)  

Sensors/Actuators:  
visual: keyboard / screen  
audio: microphone / speaker  
interaction is constrained by interface

**Interaction Design**  
pre defined interactions -> clarity  
gamification / "playing around" -> exploration  
explicit or implicit standards -> conventions, culture  
*explicit*: clear and intentional information. eg verbal commands, visual indicators, physical gestures  
*implicit*: subtle interactions, context and shared understanding. eg robot motions (slowing down, ...), adapting to human behavior (moving aside if approached, ...), shared context (knowing task/environment and make decisions wihtout explicit commands)  


**5 Dimensions of Interaction Design**  
*verbal*: interaction through words  
*visual*: graphic elements, cons, font, ...  
*spatial*: physical objects (grasping, moving, gesture, ...)  
*temporal*: time is critical for successful interaction (delays, ...)  
*behavioral*: action and reaction. combination of all others  

**spatial interaction**  
Avoid moving through personal space while navigating  
*0.0-0.5m* Intimate Space  
*0.5-1.2m* private Space  
*1.2-3.7m* social Space  
*3.7-inf* public Space  

User expects the robot to communicate intentions. Missing communication is discomfort/anxiety, agression against the robot, decreasing general acceptance of robots
